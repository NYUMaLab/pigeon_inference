%% to-do list

% last 2 diagnostic plots for each model made into subplots for plots
% dashed lines instead of dotted
% fix aspect ratio
% fix legend
% 1 by 3 subplot, each row is a model.
% Split up by category of model (ABCD)

% EM same as brute-force (ex 7 and 27)

% 15, 23-25 are slightly more flexible versions of 32 - 35... think about
% how to present these if at all?

% ROC curve stuff-- and best fitting model qualitative fit

% Reaction time plot in supplement
% RT by number of pigeons
% RT as function of decision variable from winning model - people react
% longer when more uncertain?
